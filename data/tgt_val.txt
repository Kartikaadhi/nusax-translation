I wondered why the cost is pedestrian and well, turns out the taste is not that far off, yeah. Only the place looks the part of a restaurant, but the taste ... Well, y'know.
At least check my message, there's a complicated problem, details are in DM
This restaurant used to be my favorite because the price was relatively low and the taste was pretty good. But now there seems to be a decline in their food quality and it's no longer special. Sometimes when it's fully booked, we have to reserve a place and the other annoying part is that the service will become slower
It's a vintage resto with a pretty affordable price. The imarket and ice-cream choices have a lot of variety and they're all great. The rhum raisin ice cream in particular is one of the most highly recommended. For the pastry, the eclair and picnic rolls will leave you wanting for more. Aside from desserts, this resto also has great main courses.
A Balinese restaurant with the concept of eating in the ricefields. Scenery resemblant of the villages. The food is excellent.
Support for construction's limited. My whole village feels disappointed in this.
I'm actually disappointed with those who use their differences to attack their siblings with nasty words. Come on. being different ain't that big a deal.
The kids really loved the mushroom soup, the taste wasn't like the others, it was very European. Me and my husband had some coffee, and our kids enjoyed their fresh milk, all served in a unique way, and they loved it. And don't even get me started on the macarons. Top notch. 
The room's dirty and smelly, there's a used towel, too. Seems like ya'll forgot to clean the room before the new guest arrived. Cockroaches and mosquitos everywhere. Bed's filthy, ordered 1 large-sized bed but given twin beds instead.
The images in the menu are intersting but aren't consistent with reality when served. In the seafood claypot tofu, the fish was already rotten. The porridge was average and stank of flour. The seafood rice barely had any seafood. Just the rice and onions.
How do I stop subscribing to Indihome, hm? Slow, and also expensive.  I'm starting to feel bogged down to use and pay for it.

We came to this 18th resto to celebrate our first wedding anniversary. We ordered appetizers, courses, and drinks. When our food came, the plating was absolutely classy, they didn't mess up anything. The food portion we thought to be small turned out to be so huge that we couldn't finish them all. The service was perfect, we met with Ms. Isna, and as soon as we arrived in this resto, we got ourselves a table. 
Okay. I'll go to the nearest BCA branch immediately
For such a low price, Lion Air's service is pretty decent.
We recommend using another device first such as a desktop browser or a laptop to make transactions in Tokopedia.
I finally found the correct way to activate Talkomsel's roaming package
How could you almost crash in such a traffic jam?
The answer is not satisfying. I want to berate that customer service.
The food we ordered ere is almost always such a delight. My kid really likes it because there's a swimming pool. We can eat and the kid can be left alone to play in the water. Eheehe what an amazing sensation. Price ranges from 20 - 100 thousand, the services are good
The Walini tea garden is located in Rancabali, Ciwidey, just a few minutes after Kawah Putih. Here we can see vast tea plantations, around 8 hectares. Perfect place for prewedding photo shoots.
The BCA Bank in PGC has pathetic services. I regret ever being their customer if I knew it'd be like this.
I wish I could get my kid a Redmi 5a because he/she really wants it. I just happened to see a Redmi 5a on a previous flash sale. I've added it to my cart but the payment process failed so I didn't get it.
Looks like Indonesians have started to get sick of soap operas.
Sobat 7 still have a chance to check out the snippets at 19.25 WIB
We can file a request for a refund in one of the stations selected by our company, at the latest, 30 minutes before departure.
Bought milk at the minimarket, turns out it was 3 days past its expiration date. What a joke!
Fun place to hang out, lots of meals to choose from, interior is unique and exterior is great. Ordered iced tea and chicken porridge yesterday, both tasted amazing, the servers were also nice and friendly. It's in the center of the city, too.
Is it wrong for someone who has done their responsibility to then ask for their rights? Please, if you wanna be appreciated, appreciate others as well, don't play dumb. That's irritating!
After visiting the cliff near the palace, me and the other trip participants decided to have lunch at Boemi Joglo. We ordered nasi liwet for 8 people, and they only served them to us after over an hour. Oh, and we had to wait some more for the spoons, forks, and plates. It was very clear that the crew couldn't handle the overwhelming crowd
This time, just by spending Rp 60 thousand in Alfamart Homecare, you can get cooking oil for only 5 hundred
Lousy Messi, can't even take Argentina to the finals again
The room key's so difficult to use, should be fixed soon
So noisy. Salary's already high, but still backing the street vendors. Horrible
This place offered indoor and outdoor seats. Because we brought the whole family, we chose the outdoor spot. We only ordered the goat satay and curry.
One of my favorite food is tofu. Other than the fact that it's not too expensive, this food is also considered healthy. Yun Yi tofu can be easily obtained in supermarkets, while Yun Sen tofu has their own way of processing theirs.
The only thing interesting about this cafe is the eating-in-the-dark concept. If you get past that, there's really not much else. The food is okay enough. Nothing really special here
70% of the voting netizens says this person is a liar. Do y'all still wanna belive him?
I really hate throwing up food I've already eaten. Feels so unpleasant
My shirt went missing and they took no responsibility whatsoever. 3-star hotel but couldn't deal with a thief. Horrible services.
Madame Sari is a resto owned by Kartika sari. Smart management by arranging the resto inside their building, allowing for easy access for the customers who wanna eat after buying brownies and other snacks. ...
This simple resto is hella crowded with visitors, the most popular food menu ordered has to be its Ayam Penyet Sambal. The flavour is tasty and just right for an Indonesian's taste buds.
Just count the V9 in this picture, you'll get a surprise from Bhinneka!
The venue's got indoor and semi-outdoor spots., cool breeze, varied menu, huge portions, and relatively cheap price for satisfying portion flavour. The service is good as well. Hella recommended, alright!
Traveloka first, vacation later hahahaha, we sure sound just like the commercials huh?
Positive. Economical, satisfactory taste, hospitable service, and great texture on the noodles.
This hotel's services are utterly disappointing
Is it true that the number one is considered a lucky charm in Javanese regional head election?
As far as I know, BRI resto is open from 13:00 until 14:00 WIB. But you can still have transactions when there are at least 2 tellers and 2 CS-es.
The Barca vs Milan duel is met with heavy rain the whole day! Even mother nature knows and cries after watching both side's dirty tricks tsktsktsk
Delish food, cool, comfy place. Best visited in the noons to be able to enjoy the scenery. Afternoons are fun, too, though.
The staff was not kind at all, they slammed the plates into our table, and just put our drinks haphazardly, without telling us which drink was which. So far, the price was way too costly. For the flavour, the ones with veggies were too salty
Been here a few times, but never got sick of its romantic, soothing atmosphere, feels like a personal resto. From the food to the service, everything's top notch. Highly recommended to visit here.
PSSI has a backup plan while waiting for Luis Milla
Got a design gig once in the bakery from 8 in the morning, and worked until 6 the next morning before going home from that bakery.
Opposition's selling power, having no quality by continuously spreading hoax.
Seriously, Eiger's stuff are top notch
Eating here feels great. The package is affordable for large groups. The food tastes amazing. The sambal was good, and they always have a jar of kerupuk aci. And also, you gotta try the juice. It's so good and fresh, they mix fruits and vegetables really well
Will never get tired of coming back here, especially in Friday and Saturday nights when there's live music. The food is delicious, it's absolutely awesome, never disappointing and will definitely return
Getting inside Resto Sagoo, we were greeted by antique interior, the old school decors reminded us of old stuff in our old kitchen. The food offered was also distinctly ancient, the price and flavor matched each other, in that they were mediocre and nothing special. The dining room and food presentation were also quite plain.
JNE is always amazing, even their courier berates me. No, I won't be using f**cking JNE ever again
Due to electrical short circuit, two Tongkonan traditional houses went up in flames.
Located on the mountain peak with awesome scenery. Service is friendly and quick. The food is varied.
To whom it may concern in BCA Bank, I think you should increase the number of Customer Service Representation Officers. You wouldn't want to be labelled as a huge bank with crap service, don't you?
Toyota releases their newest product.
The cafe in Northern Bandung is a cafe that only sells the view, don't expect food with large portions. But truly, the mood  is rather nostalgia-inducing, a spacious place like this could give the peace from the hustle and bustle of the cities. The place is comfortable, homey, relaxing, and lush.
The UU Ormas revisions will be added as a national legislation program in this month's hearing. That's the agreement made by the legislative body.
Great place to stay with loved ones, hang out, or chat with friends. All in all, highly recommended
The fried chicken's crispy, coupled with its signature sauce, the ice cream sundae is refreshing and pretty affordable, with four kinds of flavours, namely chocolate, strawberry, blueberry, and kiwi.
I think the mango I saw on that tree yesterday has been eaten by a bat.
No contest, yo, hope the device is long-lastin'.
Ideal dining spot for students to stuff their stomachs and hang out with friends. The place is pretty fun, the food choices are plentiful, from Asian, Indonesian, and Western, all for reasonable prices. The service here is also pretty good.
Bought this product because everyone and their mother said it was the best, but really, I didn't get the same impression
There are lots of flaws that I noticed after buying this brand of handphone. The camera's ugly. The speaker's dirty. The screen's hard on the eyes, too.
After seeing the entire area, we can say that Dusun Bambu is a good place to hunt. From the bamboo nest to the lake. Insya Allah we will return in May to enjoy its beautiful atmosphere again.
The noodles are so similar to the original Mie Nursijan that no longer exists since the chef has passed away. The fried rice is also recommended.
Excuse me, I had an order from Regensi to Multazam hospital paid with GoPay but the money wouldn't get into my deposit. Please help.
Indeed the price does not lie. The price of the food and beverages here may be expensive. But it is appropriate with the taste and place provided.
I've eaten here a few times. The place is perfect for relaxing with friends or family. The price is also fairly reasonable. I like the Rawon
Immediately nauseous, noodles were too mushy, took way too long to come out, and the servers were aloof
If you're looking for an affordable homemade food in Jalan Braga, check this place out. The menu is perfectly homely, with great taste especially for the sambal enjoyers. The place isn't too big, but there's live music, and sometimes even visitors can sing. It's pretty clear that this place isn't for people who like peace and quiet.  
For those looking for a nostalgic traditional Sundanese meal with tin plates and cups, this is the choice restaurant. This place is in the heart of the city, near Gedung Sate, so keep in mind that in holidays especially Sundays, this area will surely be packed and crowded.
...The place was so vast, yet so empty on a Sunday night. This wasn't a good sign for a resto. The food was lacklustre as well, the fish wasn't fresh at all since it was already tasteless. Not memorable and not recommended to anyone.
The taste lacks deliciousness. For a Korean resto, the flavour is not authentic. The place is good, the decor is comfortable.
The place is comfortable because there's plenty of space between the tables. The food is also great, especially the crab combo menu. The sauce is kinda spicy but still delicious enough to get seconds, especially accompanied with the rice or bread that comes with the menu.
The incumbent pair of Pilkada Garut is still in the lead for now
A very strategic location in the city of Medan, really fun to bring your family to this location, as far as the cost is concerned, just follow the readily available menu.
Simpang Raya restaurant. Our family's most favorite is the pop fried chicken. Also seasoned roast chicken and crispy fried chicken.
Dumbass thinks any citizen can get away with doing bad stuff. He's out of his mind
I'd say the location was pretty ideal, just accross the highway. The menu was decently varied, ranging from noodles, bread, coffee, etc. I ordered a boiled Indomie Saos Telur Asin with broth that time, along with iced orange juice and vanilla treasure for dessert. Its taste is also pretty alright.
Don't just believe in online news, y'all. Lotsa hoaxes.
The facility is great, my kids are happy. There's TV, mini farm, the lake's great, the food's complete, and the garden's layout is natural and organized.
Just left this diner because the food we ordered were mostly out. The place was so crowded and we came a bit late in the afternoon. We waited for more than half an hour only to find out that half our orders weren't available. The last order we made hadn't been made either.
We've counted the votes and found a trace of foul play. There's gotta be some bribing involved to make him win.
Please inform which ATM in Semarang can be used to withdraw cash from BCA Mobile, thank you.
My friend recommended this place because of its signature fishball noodles. Location's close to Mesjid Agung. Simple, but clean place. One portion costs Rp 55.000, while the avocado drink costs Rp 30.000. When it comes to taste, it's certainly delicious and the price don't lie.
The first time coming here, I understimated this place, but once I got here and heard the soothing traditional Sundanese music, I knew that this was a comfortable eatery. The food was inexpensive for my family, and the servers were very hospitable. All around I highly recommend this, totes. Very nice, Kampung Daun.
The venue's fun both for people with families or couples. There's a pretty interesting special menu here. You might wanna bring some friends to help you finish it. In fact, that's where the fun begins. Yup, just try out the Super Jumbo Black Burger, rounding up to 16 cm in diameter.
There have been two earthquakes in Lombok recently
